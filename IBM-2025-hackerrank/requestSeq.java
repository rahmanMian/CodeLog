/*an API request optimization system, a sequence of binary request codes, represented by requestSeq, consists of '0's and '1's. The system requires that this sequence be divided into non-overlapping segments of even length, where each segment contains only identical request codes (either all '1's or all '0's). Implement a function to calculate the minimum number of request code flips (changing '0' to '1' or '1' to '0') required to meet this requirement.

Input:

A string requestSeq consisting solely of the characters '0' and '1', representing the sequence of binary request codes.
Output:

An integer representing the minimum number of flips required to transform requestSeq into non-overlapping, even-length segments of identical request codes.
Example 1:

Input: "11010010"
Output: 2
Explanation: Flip two '1's to get "11110000", resulting in segments "1111" and "0000".
Example 2:

Input: "101011"
Output: 2
Explanation: Flip two '0's to get "111111", resulting in a single segment "111111".
Constraints:

The length of requestSeq is between 1 and 10‚Åµ.*/
