Step 1 -> 5 min
Understand the problem
Step 2 -> 20 min
Propose High Level Design and get buy in
Step 3 -> 15 min
Design Deep Dive
Step 4 -> 5 min
Wrap up

Step 1:
Red flag to jump in
Who are the users?
What is the purpose?
Eg Chat App
What chat app do you need eg- Skype whatsapp discord have their own needs
Decide Features to build -> make sure interviewer agrees
Non Functional requirements -> scale and performance 

AT THE END:
1. Short features to design for
2. Non Functional requirements


Step 2:
Start with APIS -> establish contract between users and backend
Turn requirements -> APIS USE REST IF NOT SPECIFY
DO NOT INTRO APIS NOT CONNECTED TO REQUIREMENTS
WEBSOCKET FOR TWO WAY -> HARD TO SCALE
NOW HHL DESIGN DIAGRAM
BLUEPRINT
START WITH LOAD BALANCER > DATA STORAGE LAYER SCRATCH THE TOP
While developing design maintain discussion points for later eg database scaling high concurrency failure scenarios
DONT GO INTO DETAIL
Final step -> data model and schema
discuss db choices and indexing options
Take a step back and review

Step 3:
Identity potential problematic areas
talk to interviewer about this
Pick up onn interviewr body lang if shown sign of distress
Discussion:
Aritculate the Problem
Make two solutions
Discuss trade off solutions -> use numbers
Pick solution and discuss implementaiton

Step 4:
Summarize desing
focus on unique parts of sol
ask interview about company too
