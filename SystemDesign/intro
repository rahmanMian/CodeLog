Step 1 -> 5 min
Understand the problem
Step 2 -> 20 min
Propose High Level Design and get buy in
Step 3 -> 15 min
Design Deep Dive
Step 4 -> 5 min
Wrap up

Step 1:
Red flag to jump in
Who are the users?
What is the purpose?
Eg Chat App
What chat app do you need eg- Skype whatsapp discord have their own needs
Decide Features to build -> make sure interviewer agrees
Non Functional requirements -> scale and performance 

AT THE END:
1. Short features to design for
2. Non Functional requirements


Step 2:
Start with APIS -> establish contract between users and backend
Turn requirements -> APIS USE REST IF NOT SPECIFY
DO NOT INTRO APIS NOT CONNECTED TO REQUIREMENTS
WEBSOCKET FOR TWO WAY -> HARD TO SCALE
NOW HHL DESIGN DIAGRAM
BLUEPRINT
START WITH LOAD BALANCER > DATA STORAGE LAYER SCRATCH THE TOP
