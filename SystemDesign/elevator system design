Step 1:
Red flag to jump in
What can the elevator do > up,down, idle
What is the purpose? transfer passengers from one floor to another
What should id do > open the door when idle
How many floorss > 200
How many elevator cars > 50 
this is based on burjmax ho
What are teh specs of the elevator car > number of passangers can hold/max speed the elevaotr can hold
What do we miniize:
Wait time of system
Wait time of passenger
Do we want to minimize power usage
Minimise cost
Zone the floors for elevators > divide and conquer
Emergency alarms
Vip elevetors
Moinitoring systems


AT THE END:
1. Short features to design for
2. Non Functional requirements


Step 2:
Objects > Passaenger, Elevator Car, floors, doors, button panels(in and out), button pannel(floor numbers), Dispatch system(pick closest eleavators), Monitoring systems
Actor > Passenager class > dont need as it is not a simulation system

Use Cases:
1.Calling Elevator
2.Move or stop elevtor
3.Open or close the doors
4.Elevator direction
5.Indicating elevator floor
6.Emergency break
7.Emergency call

Classes and Interfaces:
Button interface(pressDown(), isPressed())
Elevator Buttons Class  and Hall Button Class use button interface
Door Class Open() Close() isOpen()
Elevator Motion Interface move(destination floor) stop() 



Start with APIS -> establish contract between users and backend
Turn requirements -> APIS USE REST IF NOT SPECIFY
DO NOT INTRO APIS NOT CONNECTED TO REQUIREMENTS
WEBSOCKET FOR TWO WAY -> HARD TO SCALE
NOW HHL DESIGN DIAGRAM
BLUEPRINT
START WITH LOAD BALANCER > DATA STORAGE LAYER SCRATCH THE TOP
While developing design maintain discussion points for later eg database scaling high concurrency failure scenarios
DONT GO INTO DETAIL
Final step -> data model and schema
discuss db choices and indexing options
Take a step back and review

Step 3:
Identity potential problematic areas
talk to interviewer about this
Pick up onn interviewr body lang if shown sign of distress
Discussion:
Aritculate the Problem
Make two solutions
Discuss trade off solutions -> use numbers
Pick solution and discuss implementaiton

Step 4:
Summarize desing
focus on unique parts of sol
ask interview about company too
